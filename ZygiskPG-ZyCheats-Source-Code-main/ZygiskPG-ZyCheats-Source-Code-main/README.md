# ZygiskPG
ZyCheats or ZygiskPG, designed specifically for the popular mobile game Pixel Gun 3D. 

The mod was developed by Chr1s, Fedesito, and OhMyFajjet and was previously a closed-source and paid product. 
However, due to legal issues, the mod has been open-sourced and made available for public contribution, this source is now only for educational purposes, we don't take fault for what people do with this.  
The mod was developed entirely in C++, utilizing zygisk, Its used to modify the game Pixel Gun 3D, to give the user advantages.  

This decision will allow everyone to understand how ZygiskPG works, Its also helpful for the developers to patch this module.  

We removed our authentication system for obvious reasons.

Its based on version 23.1.3, We aren't going to update it anymore.
